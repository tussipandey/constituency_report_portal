# constituency_report_portal
Constituency report system is an automated report card of any constituency of a region where the respective voters can report about the development status of that particular area.
This project contains a web portal that has options for providing feedback for various works done in that constituency.Any elligible voter will be able to submit their response by providing their unique ID.
As per requirements this project will have 5 files that will contain all the data about the respective representatives of that area and different work parameters on which their performance in their reign will be judged upon.This project will help the voters and also the political parties to judge their candidates by providing a quantitative and statisticial measure of their performance.After this they will have a more clearer perspective about the candidate to elect.

We will be using HTML,CSS,Javascript for the front end and Python for all the backend and file operations.Various File Structure techniques like hashing,B-trees,Indexing etc will be thoroughly used in the project.
